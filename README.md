# Learning Angular HTTP 
### Angular HTTP API | Full Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8qDGBFPfXk

Almost all Angular applications need to make HTTP requests to a back-end web API to retrieve, save, update, and delete data (CRUD Operations).

POST − Create  
GET − Read  
PUT − Update  
DELETE − Delete  

The Angular HTTP course teaches basic, as well as advanced features of Angular HTTP Communication.
